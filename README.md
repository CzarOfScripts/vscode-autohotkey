# Visual Studio Code Autohotkey Sharp

A personal edition modified from [vscode-autohotkey](https://github.com/vinnyjames/vscode-autohotkey)

AutoHotKey language support for VS Code
* Color Syntax(1.1.32 version)
* Comment blocks
* Snippets
* Doucment symbol(class and method) 
* Goto Definition(limited support)
  * only work `foo(params*)` and `{` is in the same line
* Signature Helper (tooltip for method parameters)
* Code format (might unsuited for your code)

## Further Plan

* [ ] Language server
* [ ] Syntax analyze based parser  
* [ ] Enable documentation markdown
